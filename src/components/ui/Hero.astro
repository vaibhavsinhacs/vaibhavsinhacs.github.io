    I am particularly interested in developing models that can navigate complex, multimodal data,
    interpret nuanced contextual information, and perform robustly in challenging settings like small
    or skewed datasets. My research interests also align with topics such as model interpretability,
    fairness, and scalability, with a focus on building trustworthy AI systems for critical applications
    like healthcare and other areas.
