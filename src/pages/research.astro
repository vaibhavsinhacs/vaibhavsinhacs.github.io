    <div class="mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Real-world data is rarely clean or unimodal. Whether in healthcare, finance, or autonomous systems,
        models must navigate complex, heterogeneous information streams while maintaining reliability in the
        face of uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research focuses on developing machine learning architectures that are inherently robust and
        interpretable. I am interested in solving fundamental challenges related to learning from small
        or skewed datasets, ensuring that AI systems remain fair and trustworthy when deployed in critical,
        high-stakes environments.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        By addressing the fragility of current machine learning models, my work aims to build AI systems that are
        not only accurate on benchmarks but reliable in the wild. This reliability is the key to unlocking the
        potential of AI in critical sectors where safety and transparency are paramount.
